        <p>
          At our core, we live by these ideals, with our partners, coffee, and
          consumers at our centre by fostering an environment where everyone is
          accepted and feels warmly welcomed, bravely taking action, questioning
          the existing quo, and coming up with fresh ideas to advance both our
          business and one another. demonstrating openness, decency, and respect
          while being present, giving whatever we do our all and taking
          responsibility for the outcomes, as seen through the prism of
          humanity, we are performance motivated.
